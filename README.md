# PJT
in the arduino_serial.ino, there is the code used to test the bluetooth connection. It reads information given by the HM10, stop when 
encountering a '$' (this symbol signifies the end of the command)
This is the first piece of code for the test, I will add functions that analyse the commands given by the android app and controls the motor(s)

in the "idealist.rar" , there is all the resouces files needed to create the android app, You might need android studio in order to read 
and test the files. (the files are in a rar file because the number of files exceeded 100)
